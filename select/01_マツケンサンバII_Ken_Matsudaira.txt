Come play the bongos
Come hear the samba
Dance to the rhythm of the carnival
Let's party day and night
Until we feel all right
Don't stop the fun tonight
We are shining bright!

I feel the hot breeze blow
And let my body go
I wanna dance and dance
Until I'm in a trance
The waves sing my song
With samba, we belong
The rhythm in my heart
We'll never be apart

Olé, olé! Matsuken Samba
Olé, olé! Matsuken Samba
Ah, fall in love (amigo)
Just dance (senorita)
Forget about the time today and
Let's dance the night away
Samba, viva, samba!
Matsuken Samba! Olé!

Come play the bongos
Come hear the samba
Dance to the rhythm of the carnival
Time passes by, it seems
Just like in happy dreams
Romance is everywhere
A tropical affair

Your golden skin, I see
Holding you close to me
I whisper words of love so sweet, come dance with me
Right here on this white shore
Our love is shining more
An invitation from the wind
We start to sing

Olé, olé! Matsuken Samba
Olé, olé! Matsuken Samba
Ah, fall in love (amigo)
Just dance (senorita)
Forget about the time today and
Let's dance the night away
Samba, viva, samba!
Matsuken Samba! Olé!
